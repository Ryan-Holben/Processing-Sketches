# Processing Sketches

### What is Processing?
[Processing](www.processing.org) is a fun and easy way to code up graphical "sketches" of various things which you find interesting.  Processing sketches are coded in a special subset of Java, but Processing has also been ported to other JavaScript and Python.

### What can you use it for?
I enjoy using Processing to show mathematical and physical phenomena in interactive and (slightly) artistic ways.  Generally, I will use Processing if I have an idea for something fun that I want to quickly visualize.  If the project is a little more serious, I turn to other languages

I have lost some of my Processing sketches with computer upgrades and moves, but here are a few recent ones.  I will continue to update this page with sketches that seem worth saving.

## Sketches
#### Markov Fractal
<img src="assets/markovfractal.png" align=left> Generates "fractals" (incorrect terminology, certainly) using a swarm of ants.  The ants leave trails, and are each driven by a Markov chain state machine.  By pressing the numbers 1-9, you can change the transition probabilities which drive the ants, thus changing the overall shape they make. (Note that these are _not_ [Langton's ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant), but they take some inspiration there.)

### life
<img src="assets/life.png" align=left> Classic Conway's game of life, sped up a bit.  I am also playing with a variant known as smooth life.

### OneDCA
<img src="OneDCA.png" align=left> A simple template to run 1-dimensional cellular automata.  In its current form it produces the [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle).
